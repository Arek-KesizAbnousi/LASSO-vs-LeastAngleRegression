# LARS-LASSO-path_algorithm-R_code-
- We Code the least angle regression solution (LARS) path by hand for an example(p=5),
then we compute the solution of LARS for a dataset. Finally we do the same for LASSO path and compare it with LARS.

- LARS and LASSO paths can only differ when a coefficient’s value crosses zero. In other words,  When coefficient’s value do not crosses zero. LARS and LASSO paths will be exactly same. Consequently ,  we make plot of the coefficients for both LASSO and LARS to compare the LARS and LASSO path.

- R Libraries used lars and glmnet
